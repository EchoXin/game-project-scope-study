1 The game will have 3 section: header(sign in, sign up and sign out), main  section(introduction and game-board) and footer(copyright)

2 object and array

3 The game board consists of 3*3 ceils and I'll store the value of the ceils in an array.
4 I will build a wireframe  by HTML and CSS, then make the basic function work like sign  -in and sign-up. After that, I will write javascript code to make the game work.

5 As a user, I want to sign up to this game so that I can record my game processing.
  As a user, I want to be reminded when I win the game so that I can know the game result.
  As a user, I want to sign out to this game so that I can prevent other people to use my account.
  As a user, I want to add one more game role so that I can play with my friend.
  As an administrator, I want to approve the users' emails and passwords before they can sign in so that I won't miss up their game record.

6 I will seperate the code to different section. like sign-in module or game-board module.

7 I want to give the winner a score according the steps he use. and display the rating of all users after the game ending.

8 I will use GIT to commit every change I make.

9 I want to attempt the "watch" function.
